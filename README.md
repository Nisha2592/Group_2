# Group_2

**To run the application in the development branch:**
* 1. $ cmake -S . -B build
  2. $ cmake --build build 
  This will generate an executable main.x in build directory. To run this
  3. cd to examples then run the following input file for example 
  4. $ ../buid/main.x < argon_108.inp 
  5. This will generate some numbers that we can then compare to the non-split version
     of this application that Axel gave us
